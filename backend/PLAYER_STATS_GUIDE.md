# Player Statistics Processing Guide

This guide explains how to use the player statistics processing functionality that enhances player data with advanced metrics and visualizations.

## Overview

The player statistics processing module takes the raw data scraped from ESPNCricinfo and performs:

1. **Data Cleaning** - Standardizes column names, handles missing values, and converts data types
2. **Feature Engineering** - Calculates consistency indices, performance metrics against specific teams/venues
3. **Player Profile Generation** - Creates comprehensive player profiles with advanced statistics
4. **Performance Visualization** - Generates performance charts for visual analysis

## Usage Instructions

### Command Line Usage

Use the Django management command to process player statistics:

```bash
# Process all players
python manage.py enhance_player_stats

# Process a specific player
python manage.py enhance_player_stats --player "Virat Kohli"

# Generate performance plots
python manage.py enhance_player_stats --plots

# Export player profiles as JSON and CSV
python manage.py enhance_player_stats --export both

# Update database with processed stats
python manage.py enhance_player_stats --update-db

# Preview changes without updating database
python manage.py enhance_player_stats --update-db --dry-run
```

### API Usage

The player statistics processing functionality is also available through API endpoints:

    "M. A. Chidambaram Stadium": {"matches": 5, "avg_runs": 45.2}
  }
}
```

#### 4. Get Player Performance Chart

```http
GET /api/players/1/performance_chart/?type=form
Authorization: Bearer <your_token>
```

Response:
```json

}
```

## Player Profile Structure

Each player profile contains the following information:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | Player name |
| `role` | Player role (BAT, BWL, AR, WK) |
| `team` | Player's current team |
| `average_runs_last_5` | Average runs in last 5 matches |
| `average_wickets_last_5` | Average wickets in last 5 matches |
| `batting_consistency_index` | Index measuring batting consistency (1-10) |
| `bowling_consistency_index` | Index measuring bowling consistency (1-10) |
| `performance_vs_opposition` | Performance data against each team |
| `venue_stats` | Performance data at each venue |
| `avg_fantasy_points` | Average fantasy points per match |

## Consistency Index

The consistency index is calculated using the following formula:

```
Consistency Index = (Mean รท (Standard Deviation + 1)) ร 10
```

This provides a score between 0-10, where higher scores indicate more consistent performance. The formula rewards players with:
- Higher average performance
- Lower variation in performance

## Available Charts

1. **Recent Form Chart** - Line chart showing runs/wickets over last 5 matches
2. **Opposition Performance Chart** - Bar chart showing average runs/wickets against different teams
3. **Venue Performance Chart** - Bar chart showing average runs/wickets at different venues

## Testing

To test the player statistics processing module:

```bash
python test_player_stats_processor.py
```

This will:
1. Create sample cricket data
2. Test data processing
3. Generate player profiles
4. Create sample charts

## Integration with Dream11 Predictions

The enhanced player statistics are automatically used by the prediction algorithm to generate more accurate team predictions based on:

- Player consistency
- Performance against specific opponents
- Performance at specific venues

This results in better fantasy team selections with higher probability of success.
